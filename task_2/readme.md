# 🔍 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📝 Objective
This task explores the Titanic dataset to understand its structure and discover meaningful patterns through statistics and visualizations.

---

## 🚀 What Was Done
- ✅ Generated **summary statistics** (mean, median, std) for numeric columns.
- ✅ Created **histograms** & **boxplots** to analyze feature distributions and detect outliers.
- ✅ Plotted **pairplots** and **correlation matrix** to understand relationships between features.
- ✅ Identified **skewness**, **missing data**, and **potential correlations**.
- ✅ Visualized key features like `Age`, `Fare`, `Pclass`, and `Survived` for further insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- 🐍 **Python 3.x**
- 📊 **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- 🎨 **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- 🧠 **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive exploration

## 🖼️ Example Visualizations
| Plot               | Description                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 📈 Histogram        | Age & Fare distribution across passengers     |
| 📊 Boxplot          | Outlier detection in `Fare` and `Age` columns |
| 🔍 Correlation Map  | Visualized relationships between features     |
| 🧠 Pairplot         | Plots feature interactions pairwise           |

## 🎯 Key Insights
- ⚠️ Found missing values in `Age` and `Embarked` — filled with median and mode.
- 📊 `Fare` is right-skewed with significant outliers.
- 📈 Strong correlation between `Pclass` and `Fare`.
- 🎨 `Survived` is higher for passengers in 1st class and females.

## 🏅 Conclusion
This EDA process revealed valuable patterns that will help shape preprocessing and feature engineering for predictive modeling.
